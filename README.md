# Apache Fancy Index
A CSS3 Compliant Fancy Index Page Created in 2011, this gives your documents some additional style when listed by Apache!

Note, the `.htaccess` file should be placed inside the root folder with a folder named `fancy-index`. If you change the folder name please update the `.htaccess` file accordingly.

 - Currently does not allow the use of sort feature although does look great! 
 - Date and time displayed in chronological file and folder order.
 
A basic upgrade of the style of your Apache Index page. Feel free to modify as you see fit!

Contact support@youds.com if you need a helping hand; this was originally created back in 2011 (see https://web.archive.org/web/20111019073843/http://css3.youds.com:80/) and is for general public use.
